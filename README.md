<h4 align="center">A machine learning project utilizing a Decision Tree Classifier to detect hate speech in text, enhancing the ability to identify and mitigate harmful content online.</h4>

## Problem Identified 🚨

The rise of online platforms has also led to an increase in hate speech, which can cause significant harm to individuals and communities. Current moderation techniques are often manual and unable to keep up with the volume of content, leading to delayed or missed detection of harmful speech. There is a need for automated systems that can quickly and accurately identify hate speech, providing timely interventions and fostering safer online environments.

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

Introducing an intelligent hate speech detection system using machine learning techniques.

### What is This Project About?

This project leverages a Decision Tree Classifier to automatically detect hate speech in textual content. By analyzing text data, the system can classify whether a given piece of content contains hate speech or not.

### How Does It Work?

The system uses a Decision Tree Classifier, trained on a labeled dataset of text instances, to predict the presence of hate speech. The classifier analyzes features extracted from the text and determines the likelihood of it being hate speech.

### Features:

- *Automated Detection:* Quickly and accurately identifies hate speech in text.
- *Machine Learning:* Utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier for classification.
- *Python-based:* Developed using Python for easy integration and flexibility.
